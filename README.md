## Report and presentation Information

Your report should be comprehensive yet concise, adhering to a maximum word limit of 2500 words and a maximum page limit of 8 pages. Ensure the report is self-contained, providing all necessary information within the given word constraint.A suggestion is that a brief intorduction providing a succinct overview of the transformer model is included. This introduction should lay the groundwork for the topics that follow. It is important to discuss key elements and insights gained from the practicals. This should include experimental results and responses to questions from the exercise sheet. (When incorporating responses to the questions from the practical sheets into your report, ensure they are seamlessly integrated into the narrative of your content, rather than presenting them as direct question-and-answer segments) Conclude with a brief summary, encapsulating the main findings and observations. While your report should mirror the structure of a standard research paper, it must not be a mere replication of the "Attention Is All You Need" paper. Originality in content and perspective is crucial.

Please include a word count at the end of your report. Note that equations are exempt from the word count.

Presentation: Prepare a 10-minute presentation that highlights the most important aspects of your report.
